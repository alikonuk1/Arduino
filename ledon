// Pin 13 has an LED connected on most Arduino boards.
// give it a name:
int led = 12;
int led1 = 8;

// the setup routine runs once when you press reset:
void setup() {                
  // initialize the digital pin as an output.
  pinMode(led, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(led1, OUTPUT);  
}

// the loop routine runs over and over again forever:
void loop() {
  digitalWrite(led, HIGH);
  digitalWrite(led1, HIGH);    // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
//  delay(1000);               // wait for a second
//  digitalWrite(led, LOW);    // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
  delay(250);                  // wait for a second
}
